# dot.dotfiles

A collection of config files, custom to me. You probably shouldn't use them. 

## Installation

**NOTE:** The installation script is extremely opinionated. It will try to save any existing config files that exist with `.BAK-{DateStamp}` extensions, but don't make any promises that it will succeed.

**NOTE:** The installation script expects to be run from the root of this repository. If you run it directly in the setup directory, it'll probably behave unexpectedly.

1. Change into the directory that you've pulled this repository from.
2. Run the script `setup/bash-setup.sh`.
